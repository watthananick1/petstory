It looks like there is an error in your code at line 167 in the file login.tsx. The error message indicates that the compiler cannot find the name 'data'.

Based on the context of your code, it seems like you might be using a form that collects data, and then attempting to retrieve the email from that form data to reset the password. However, it appears that the data variable has not been declared or initialized, causing this error.

To fix this error, make sure that the data variable is properly declared and initialized before attempting to access its properties. Depending on how you are collecting the form data, you may need to use a different method to retrieve the email value.

For example, if you are using a form library like react-hook-form, you might use something like watch('email') to retrieve the email value from the form data. If you are manually collecting the form data, you might store it in state and then retrieve the email value from the state object.
